"""Python does not have any strict rules when it comes to public, protected, or private, 
like java. So, to protect us from using the private attribute in any other class, Python does
name mangling, which means that every member with a double underscore will be changed to 
_object._class__variable when trying to call using an object. The purpose of this is to warn
 a user so he does not use any private class variable or function by mistake without realizing
 its states.The use of single underscore and double underscore is just a way of name mangling
because Python does not take the public, private and protected terms much seriously so we have
to use our naming conventions by putting single or double underscore to let the 
fellow programmers know which class they can access or which they canâ€™t."""
